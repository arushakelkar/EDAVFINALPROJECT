The objective of the interactive component is to see the number of deaths due to drug abuse in the state of Connecticut across various parameters **year,months,race,age and gender**. 

**Input parameters:**

- Year is a slider which takes values from 2012 to 2018.

- Months is a slider which takes values from 1 to 12.

- Race is a dropdown which takes one of the values from Black, Chinese,White,Asian Indian,Asian other,Hispanic Black,Hispanic White,Native American other,other and unknown.

- Age is a dropdown which takes one of the values from young,teens,mid and old.

- Gender is a dropdown which takes one of the values from male, female and unknown.

**Output graphs/plots:**

We are showing a total of 4 outputs in our interactive component:

- Linechart showing number of deaths over the years selected by the user.

- Multiple linechart showing monthwise number of deaths over the years according to the selections made by the user.

- Barchart showing frequency of deaths due to a particular chemical/chemicals according to the selections made by the user.

- Finally a table is displayed of all the filtered drug abuse death cases so that the user can see all the information for that particular selection at one place.

You can also hover over the line as well as the bar chart to see the exact values for that particular year or chemical respectively.

The introduction of the interactive component in our project makes it easier for any type of user to get information as desired by him/her across the above mentioned input parameters. The variation of information is better represented by the interactive component than the static graphs. The static visualizations are restricted only to a single parameter which is not the case in interactive component.
